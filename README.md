## DESCRIPTION: The Weather Client Utility with JSON Parsing and File Handling in Java is a comprehensive Java-based application that merges file handling operations with real-time API consumption and JSON parsing, aimed at demonstrating practical Java concepts in an integrated environment. This project leverages core Java libraries to read from, write to, and append data to local files while interacting with external APIs like OpenWeatherMap to fetch live weather information in JSON format. Initially developed using JDK 1.7 and later adapted to JDK 17, the utility runs in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a lightweight yet powerful IDE that supports Java development through essential extensions like Language Support for Java by Red Hat and Maven for Java. Apache Maven is optionally used to manage dependencies such as json-20230618.jar, which is vital for parsing JSON responses. Command Line and PowerShell are utilized to compile and execute the application with proper classpath configurations for external libraries. At its core, the project sends HTTP GET requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, retrieves weather data based on user-inputted city names, and uses the org.json library to extract key attributes like temperature, humidity, and general weather conditions from the JSON response. This data is then displayed to the user and simultaneously written or appended to a text file on the local file system, offering a simple yet effective way to log and track weather data over time. The file operations include creating new files, writing new content, reading from existing files, and appending additional information without overwriting previous entries—providing a reliable mechanism for data persistence and local storage. This makes the tool suitable for offline access and future reference of previously fetched weather data. The application serves multiple purposes, such as acting as an educational tool for beginners learning file I/O, external API handling, and third-party library usage in Java. It also forms the basis for a lightweight weather dashboard that can be expanded with graphical elements or real-time updates. Furthermore, it doubles as a data logging utility that records environmental conditions, making it suitable for integration with home automation or alerting systems that respond to changing weather patterns. The utility showcases the foundational elements of many enterprise Java applications, such as modular design, external service integration, and file-based storage, thereby offering valuable insights into how modern Java solutions are structured and deployed. It emphasizes clean code practices, error handling, and real-world usage of JSON parsing, which is commonly required in web-based or backend services. By combining essential Java I/O capabilities with RESTful API interaction and JSON data manipulation, the Weather Client Utility not only reinforces fundamental programming concepts but also bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. As a result, it stands out as a versatile, beginner-to-intermediate level project that can be further enhanced with database support, GUI integration, or multi-city tracking features to evolve into a more robust weather monitoring system. Ultimately, this project is a solid representation of how core Java features can be utilized to build functional, real-world applications that interact with dynamic data sources and provide tangible outcomes.
